The act of visualizing Caddy's movements through DY and thus thinking about her beyond what we had heard about her from her brothers made them consider and ask important questions not just about Caddy, but about women in the American south in Faulkner's time--and now. DY allowed them to 'see' what it was like to be Caddy, and our consequent discussions, about how male writers write female characters, about how brothers view sisters, about Caddy herself --were memorable." ]
