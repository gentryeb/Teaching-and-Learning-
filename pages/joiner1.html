						<p>Tip: You can do the following exercises with any Faulkner text.</p>
					</div>
				A thesis paper is one way to convey an interpretation of a literary text. A map is another mode of interpretation. In this series of activities (pick and choose or do them all), we will develop an understanding of the relationship between man and place as conveyed through DY maps for Go Down, Moses.  DY maps can help us think about the texts in ways we have not before.
	
	
</li>

				<li>Students will then apply their understandings of mapping by giving shape to their interpretive experience with a visual map that communicates their understanding of space in another paired text by another author. This is an experiential learning project in which students are asked to explore, ask questions, try out new ways of thinking, and take risks. Student projects will be graded on creativity, thoughtfulness and attention to detail as it is reflected in Learning Narratives discussing what students learned from this project.</li>

									Remember, however, as one can see in Faulkner’s As I Lay Dying, an author may be only loosely following the map and geography of Cooperstown.

								Questions
								<p class="activity-paragraph">Present how this map “interprets” the text.   Questions for consideration in your presentation and/or Learning Narrative:</p>

								<div>
									<ul class="activity-list-unordered">

										<li>Your map was designed to illustrate your “reading experience.” Now looking back at what you created, how does it demonstrate a focused interpretation with a centralized organizing principle or point of view?</li>
										<li>What questions did this investigation raise for you?  How does your map attempt to respond to these questions?  In other words, how does your map provoke higher level thinking?</li>
										<li>What does this map demonstrate about your understanding of the location of the text? How does the map complicate or clarify your understanding of the plot of the novel?</li>
										<li>
											How did the mapping process affect your understanding of interpretation?  For example, did you have to make choices for characters, events, and locations?  What is the effect of those interpretive choices?  How would another choice have affected your map?
										</li>
										<li>What was the response to your map?  How did others’ “read” or respond to it?   What did you learn about your project from hearing others response to it?</li>
										<li>After creating this map and presenting it, discussing it, and answering questions about it, what would you do differently? What worked and what didn’t work? How will you employ these understandings moving forward?</li>
