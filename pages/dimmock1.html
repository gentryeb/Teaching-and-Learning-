            <p>The coming of age theme is one of the most enduringly popular and relatable genres of fiction for beginning students of literature. This lesson plan uses the coming of age theme as an entry point into William Faulkner’s “Barn Burning'' through which students can begin to explore the historical and cultural context of Yoknapatawpha County. In pairing “Barn Burning” with Richard Wright’s “The Man Who Was Almost a Man,” students will compare two stories of young boys confronted with the socio-economic and racial barriers presented by Jim Crow era sharecropping. Both Sarty’s and Dave’s coming of age stories will be presented as opportunities to analyze how a cultural institution like sharecropping can constrain individuals based on race and class. </p>

            <h2 class="content_sub_title" id="Activities">Activities</h2>
            The following activities are designed to introduce students to the term “coming of age” and the history of sharecropping as they prepare for a writing assignment in the context of an asynchronous, online course. This is ideal for an entry level literature survey course. Students are encouraged to keep a reading journal to record their impressions as they engage with the following activities:

                    you think coming of age is such a popular genre? What features of a coming of
                    age story would appeal to young people?

                    2. If you were to write a coming of age story
                    about your own life, what would be the central moment in your life that it
                    would focus on? For Sarty, it is the moment he disobeys his father and for
                    Dave, it is the moment he shoots the mule. What would this moment be for you?
                    What did this moment teach you on your path to adulthood?

                    1. Based on the article and the videos, why do
                    you think historians have criticized the practice of sharecropping? What
                    aspects of sharecropping have been deemed unfair?

                    2. Factor what you learned about sharecropping
                    into your reading of “Barn Burning” and “The Man Who Was Almost a Man.” How
                    might learning about the history of sharecropping help to explain some of the
                    choices that Sarty and Dave made in their stories?

                    </a> and scroll
                    down through the pictures. All of these photos come from the Library of
                    Congress and depict the lives of Mississippi sharecroppers in the 1930s. This
                    is what sharecroppers and their communities would have looked like when both
                    Faulkner and Wright wrote their stories. Although Faulkner set his story in the
                    1890s, the system of sharecropping only changed slightly with the introduction
                    of new technologies. Think about how these photos of real-life sharecroppers
                    compare to how you imagined their lives to be like when you read the stories.

                    1. Choose one photo that best represents what
                    you think Sarty’s life was like in “Barn Burning.” This can be a photo that
                    represents himself, his family, his community, his work, etc. Explain what part
                    of Sarty’s life is similar to what you see in this photo and why.

                    be a photo that represents himself, his family, his community, his work, etc.
                    How does this representation of Dave’s life compare to the representation you

                    the description for both of these settings. In a short response, compare and
                    contrast how these two dwellings are described. How do these descriptions clue
                    us into the class differences between the Snopes family and the De Spain

                    Then, imagine you were creating an interactive

                    difference in socio-economic status between the Saunders family and the Hawkins
                    family, which two quotes would you pick from the story and why? Are there any

                    description and the scenes in which they are involved. Take note of what you
                    learned about the Snopes family and their employer, Major De Spain. Based on

                    and Mr. Hawkins. In what ways are they similar and in what ways are they

                    participated in would you include to help explain the motivations for the ideas

                    As we saw in our reading journal activity, the
                    institution of sharecropping in the South enforced a socio-economic class
                    divide and exacerbated racial inequities during the era of Jim Crow
                    segregation. For this response, compare how Faulkner and Wright depict the
                    impact of sharecropping on class and racial division in their respective
                    stories. How does the class divide and racial discrimination impact both young
                    protagonists, Dave and Sarty, as they attempt to assert themselves as
                    individuals? How might these institutional barriers shape how they try to find
                    their autonomy and react to the adversity that they both face? Focus on core
                    similarities while also exploring how their different racial identities and
                    ages give context to the different decisions they make as they come of age in
                    the story. Consider the similar endings to the stories. Why do you think it is
                    significant that they both flee their farms at the end of their stories?
